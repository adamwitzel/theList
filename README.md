# theList

A List intended initially to provide vocabulary for describing worlds.
The scope of the project has since expanded to provide general reference as well.
By its nature this list can never be fully correct or complete.

## Notation
Leading or Trailing Character Meanings:
\+ : Category
\- : Leading=Suffix, Trailing=Prefix
\* : Questionable in some way, wrong category, too specific, uses real world information
Contained within:
    (): Comment
    {}: Reference to insert another file in place

## Guidelines
    - Use generic forms whenever possible (e.g. "Salmon" rather than "Atlantic Salmon" )
    - Avoid references to real world locations or people
    - Avoid repeated use of super name (e.g. "Chefs Knife", "Paring Knife", "Carving Knife") (Doesnt't Always Work)

## Concerns
    - Should titles include "x"r: one who "x"s?
        - I think only if the title comes with a certain connotation apart from its dictionary meaning.
    - The list is in english, how accepted in english should the word be to be included. (Zweihander) Does it need to have a english synonym?
    - Where is the line between tool and weapon?
    - Can generic be sufficient for two very different things that share the same generic name?

## TODO
    - Ongoing: Add more items to the List. The point of the whole thing
    - Make script to add quotations for json format, remove comments, substitute in references
    - Split off less useful or longer sections into separate files with references in their places

## Completed
    - Animal Section Reorganization
