# theList

A List intended initally to provide vocabulary for describing primarily fantasy worlds.
The scope of the project has since expanded to provide general reference as well.

## Guidelines
    - Use generic forms whenever possible (e.g. "Salmon" rather than "Atlantic Salmon" )
    - Avoid references to real world locations or people
    - Avoid repeated use of super name (e.g. "Chefs Knife", "Paring Knife", "Carving Knife") (Doesnt't Always Work)

## TODO
    - Make script to add quotations for json format
    - New Groups to create and fill in
        - Explorers
        - Authors
        - Astronomers
        - Generals
        - Historians
        - Inventors
