# theList

A List intended initally to provide vocabulary for describing primarily fantasy worlds.
The scope of the project has since expanded to provide general reference as well.

## Guidelines
    - Use generic forms whenever possible (e.g. "Salmon" rather than "Atlantic Salmon" )
    - Avoid references to real world locations or people
    - Avoid repeated use of super name
